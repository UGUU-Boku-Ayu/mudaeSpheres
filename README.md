Some stuff to help with mudae sphere minigames, code is a bit of a mess...

OC helper is mostly complete, only useful addition could be a most efficient space highlight.
OQ helper is still very WIP; expect it to make mistakes, but it should still be somewhat helpful.

TODO:
Improve $oq helper - Current version will sometimes label spaces incorrectly, which isn't ideal.
Rewrite the printing sections to be more efficient and readable.
